# Opitimizing Online Revenue: Case Study using SQL

Sports clothing and athleisure attire is a huge industry, worth approximately $193 billion in 2021 with a strong growth forecast over the next decade!

In the notebook, I play the role of a product analyst for an online sports clothing company. The company is specifically interested in how it can improve revenue. I dive into product data such as pricing, reviews, descriptions, and ratings, as well as revenue and website traffic, to produce recommendations for its marketing and sales teams. After going through the tables in the database, the sections are as follows:

1. Count all columns and compare with total rows to have an idea about the missing values
2. Exploring brands
3. Comparing brands (Nike and Adidas) listings prices
4. Creating a price range to have a better idea of sales of each price category
5. Calculating the average discount of each brand
6. Finding Adidas's average discount for each product category
7. Correlation between revenue and discount/price
8. Rating or Reviews or both?
9. Correlation between revenue, rating, and reviews
10. Reviews and Description (length)
11. Reviews by month and brand
12. Studying Product performance


The goal of the code snippet is to do a bit of product and user analysis to select a set of products in order to suggest them via email to each customer. To keep this campaign effective, the marketing team came up with suggesting the following items for each customer in their email:
1. The last item viewed by each customer
2. The item ordered the most
3. The best seller item from the category they order the most

These codes find the above-mentioned products from related tables in the database.
