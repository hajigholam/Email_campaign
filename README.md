# Email_campaign_SQL
The goal of this project is to do a bit of product and user analysis to select a set of products in order to suggest them via email to each customer. To keep this campaign effective, the marketing team came up with suggesting the following items for each customer in their email:
1. The last item viewed by each customer
2. The item ordered the most
3. The best seller item from the category they order the most

These codes find the above-mentioned products from related tables in the database.
