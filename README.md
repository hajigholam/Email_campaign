# Opitimizing Online Revenue: Case Study using SQL

Sports clothing and athleisure attire is a huge industry, worth approximately $193 billion in 2021 with a strong growth forecast over the next decade!

In the notebook, I play the role of a product analyst for an online sports clothing company. The company is specifically interested in how it can improve revenue.

The goal of the code snippet is to do a bit of product and user analysis to select a set of products in order to suggest them via email to each customer. To keep this campaign effective, the marketing team came up with suggesting the following items for each customer in their email:
1. The last item viewed by each customer
2. The item ordered the most
3. The best seller item from the category they order the most

These codes find the above-mentioned products from related tables in the database.
